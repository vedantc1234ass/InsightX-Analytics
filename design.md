## Design Patterns

### 1. Session State Management
- Global dataset stored in `st.session_state.df`
- Persistent across page navigation

### 2. Data Normalization
- Column name standardization (lowercase, underscore-separated)
- Text column cleaning (strip whitespace, handle nulls)
- Numeric conversion with error handling

### 3. Risk Scoring Algorithm
Multi-factor risk assessment combining:
- Fraud flag (50 points)
- Transaction amount (30 points)
- Time of day (10 points)
- Device type (10 points)
- Network type (10 points)
- Duplicate flag (10 points)

### 4. Visual Design System
- Gradient backgrounds with animation
- Glass morphism effects
- Color-coded metric cards
- Consistent color schemes:
  - Success: Green gradients
  - Warning: Orange/Yellow gradients
  - Error: Red gradients
  - Info: Blue gradients

### 5. Analytics Logging
- CSV-based event tracking
- Timestamp, event name, and details capture
- Append-only log file

## Security Considerations
- Hardcoded file paths (needs environment configuration)
- Basic authentication (username: admin, password: admin123)
- No encryption for sensitive data
- CSV-based logging (not production-ready)

## Performance Optimizations
- Data caching with `@st.cache_data`
- Efficient pandas operations
- Plotly for interactive visualizations
- Session state for data persistence

## Future Enhancements
1. Database integration (PostgreSQL/MongoDB)
2. Real-time data streaming
3. Machine learning models for fraud detection
4. Role-based access control
5. API integration for external systems
6. Advanced authentication (OAuth, JWT)
